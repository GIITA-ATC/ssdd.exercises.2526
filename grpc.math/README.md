## Adding and multiplying an arbitrary number of integers using gRPC
In this exercise we will create a simple client-server application that adds or multiplies any number of integers. The client will send the request with the list of numbers, then the server will return the sum/multiplication of the numbers. The client must print the result, and the server must run forever, listening for incoming messages.

Design the schema. Then, implement this application in Python with gRPC and Protocol Buffers.

### Requirements
Install the following Debian packages:
```bash
sudo apt install protobuf-compiler python3-protobuf python3-grp-tools
```
